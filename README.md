### Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster is a Binary Classification Problem where we predict the survival of passengers in Titanic ship.
Here the dataset contains features: Name,Pclass,Sex,Age,Ticket number,Number of Siblings,Number of Parents,Fare,Cabin number,Embarked.
Intially I replaced all string values with numericals and then removed all the null values in train and test dataset.
Then I have performed Data Analysis on Train dataset and finally I have trained the Machine Learning model with train dataset and determined by the best value of k by plotting the graph with value of k VS Accuracy.
I got best accuracy for k=10.
##### Successfully,I have trained the Machine Learning model with the given train dataset using KNN algorithm which gave 65.79% accuracy on the given test dataset.
